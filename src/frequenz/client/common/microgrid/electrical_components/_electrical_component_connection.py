    """A single electrical link between two electrical components within a microgrid.

    An electrical component connection represents the physical wiring as viewed from the
    grid connection point, if one exists, or from the islanding point, in case of an
    islanded microgrids.

    Note: Physical Representation
        This object is not about data flow but rather about the physical
        electrical connections between electrical components. Therefore, the IDs for the
        source and destination electrical components correspond to the actual setup within
        the microgrid.

    Note: Direction
        The direction of the connection follows the flow of current away from the
        grid connection point, or in case of islands, away from the islanding
        point. This direction is aligned with positive current according to the
        [Passive Sign Convention]
        (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_sign_convention).

    Note: Historical Data
        The timestamps of when a connection was created and terminated allow for
        tracking the changes over time to a microgrid, providing insights into
        when and how the microgrid infrastructure has been modified.
